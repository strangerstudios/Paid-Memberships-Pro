## Frequently Asked Questions ##

### I need help installing, configuring, or customizing the plugin. ###
Please visit [our support site at https://www.paidmembershipspro.com](https://www.paidmembershipspro.com) for more documentation and our support forums.

### I found a bug in the plugin. ###
Please post it in the [WordPress support forum](http://wordpress.org/tags/paid-memberships-pro?forum_id###10) and we'll fix it right away. Thanks for helping. 

### My site is broken or blank or not letting me log in after activating Paid Memberships Pro ###
This is typically caused by a conflict with another plugin that is trying to redirect around the login/register pages or trying to redirect from HTTP to HTTPS, etc.

To regain access to your site, FTP to your site and rename the wp-content/plugins/paid-memberships-pro folder to wp-content/plugins/paid-memberhsips-pro-d (or anything different). Now WP will not be able to find PMPro, and you can gain access to /wp-admin/ again. From there, visit the plugins page to fully deactivate Paid Memberships Pro. (You'll want to rename the folder back to paid-memberhsips-pro again.)

Long term, you will need to find and fix the conflict. We can usually do this for you very quickly if you sign up for support at https://www.paidmembershipspro.com/pricing/ and send us your WP admin and FTP credentials.

### Does PMPro Support Multisite/Network Installs? ###
"Supporting multisite" means different things to different people.

Out of the box PMPro will basically act as a stand alone plugin for each site. Each site has its own list of membership levels, members, payment settings, etc.

Our [Network/Multisite Add On](https://www.paidmembershipspro.com/add-ons/plus-add-ons/pmpro-network-multisite-membership/) allows members to choose a site name and title at checkout and will set up a network site at checkout.

Our [Network Membership Add On](https://www.paidmembershipspro.com/add-ons/plus-add-ons/pmpro-network-membership/) allows you to manage memberships at the 'Main' Network site and provide or restrict access on other Network Subsites.

If you would like more help using PMPro on a network install, sign up for support at https://www.paidmembershipspro.com.

### Does PMPro Support X? ###
